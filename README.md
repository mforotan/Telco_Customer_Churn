##Introduction

In the telecommunication industry, churn- defined as the rate at which customers discontinue their business with a service provider- is regarded as the most critical metric reflecting the overall effectiveness of various company initiatives and strategies. Churn not only indicates customer dissatisfaction but also serves as a fundamental indicator of a company's health and sustainability in a competitive marketplace. In this report, I have conducted a comprehensive analysis of a dataset comprising 14 distinct features, such as customer demographics, usage patterns, billing information, and service engagements, along with a total of 3,150 records representing individual customer interactions. The goal of this analysis is to develop a predictive model that identifies customers with a high propensity to churn, enabling proactive retention strategies.
